## Research Profile

Currently Postdoctoral Fellow at ÉTS, focusing on machine learning systems, distributed GPU training, and minimal-supervision deep learning for visual recognition tasks. PhD in Artificial Intelligence from ÉTS, contributed to the development of scalable and reproducible deep neural models for real-world applications. 

At ÉTS I am also responsible for managing high-performance GPU clusters and implementing dataset delivery platforms, authentication systems, and monitoring tools to enhance scalability and reliability. Passionate about bridging the gap between machine learning research and practical deployment with a focus on advancing reproducible and interpretable AI solutions.
